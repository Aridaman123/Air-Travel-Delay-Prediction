# Optimizing Air Travel: A Data-Driven Approach to Flight Delay Analysis & Prediction

## üöÄ Project Overview

Airline delays cost passengers time and airlines money. This project leverages historical flight data to:

- Explore delay patterns and root causes via EDA  
- Build & compare regression models to predict (a) whether a flight will be delayed and (b) its expected delay in minutes  
- Identify the top operational drivers of delay  
- Recommend data-driven interventions to reduce future delays  

## ‚öôÔ∏è Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/payalkanyan/AirTravelDelayPred
cd air-travel-delay-analysis
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate      # Linux/macOS
.venv\Scripts\activate         # Windows

pip install -r requirements.txt
```

**Key libraries:** `pandas`, `numpy`, `scikit-learn`, `xgboost`, `lightgbm`, `catboost`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`, `shap`

* Top regressors achieve sub-1 minute MAE on scaled delays
* Classification F‚ÇÇ-scores (\~0.80) emphasize recall of delayed flights

## üîç Actionable Insights & Recommendations

1. **Late Aircraft Turnaround (\~32% importance)**

   * Add 5‚Äì10 min gate buffers on high-traffic routes
   * Deploy rapid deboarding crews

2. **Carrier-Related Delays (\~24%)**

   * Optimize crew scheduling using delay-risk forecasts
   * Prioritize overnight maintenance

3. **NAS & Weather Delays (\~29% combined)**

   * Integrate live FAA advisories and METAR/TAF feeds
   * Build proactive re-routing logic

4. **Security Delays (\~7%)**

   * Ramp up TSA staffing during holiday peaks
   * Pilot automated screening lanes

## üî≠ Next Steps & Future Work

* Augment data sources with gate-utilization, real-time weather, ATC congestion, and aircraft-type info
* Real-time deployment: expose the stacking model via REST API for pre-pushback delay alerts
* Causal evaluation: conduct A/B tests or synthetic-control studies to quantify intervention impact
* Automated monitoring: build a dashboard to track drift in MAE/RMSE and F‚ÇÇ, schedule monthly retraining
